# hello!

My name is Garrett Welson (he/him/his). I'm a UI engineer at LinkedIn, where I build frontend web features on our feed. I learned to code at Hack Reactor, a bootcamp in Austin, TX. Before that, I worked in various education-adjacent roles, ranging from a business analyst at an ed-tech startup to doing community outreach and education in the green energy sector. I studied political science at Williams College and Oxford University. Outside of work, I love cooking, playing with every dog, spending time outside, reading, and trying new beers.

# what's going on here?

This site is a launching point for side projects/exploratory demos, my blog, my resume, and any other online shennanigans I get up to. If you want to pick my brain about career growth/bootcamps/breaking into tech, I'm generally happy to talk but I ask that you read my FAQ first to save us both some time before we connect. You can find me in lots of Discords/Slacks for open source communities, notably for EmberJS and Eleventy, which are two of the web technologies I'm most excited about right now.
